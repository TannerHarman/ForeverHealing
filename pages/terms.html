          <p>PUBLIC FORUMS</p>
          <h4 class='sub-title'>Public Forum Participation Policy and Terms</h4>
          <p>As a service to our users, the Site may, but shall not be obligated to, feature message boards, chat rooms/areas, discussion forums, ratings, comments, bulletin board services, news groups, communities and/or other message or communication facilities and other public/semi-public/private forums (collectively, “Forums”) where users with similar interests or similar experiences can share information and support one another, or where users can post questions for others to answer. We may also offer online discussions moderated by various experts or other persons.<br />
          Much of the content of the Forums, including, without limitation, the descriptions for many Forums and the content within a specific message, comment, or posting, is provided by and is the responsibility of the third party creator of the Forum or the person posting in that Forum. Company has no responsibility for such content, and is merely providing access to such content as a service to you.</p>
          <h4 class='sub-title'>BY THEIR VERY NATURE, FORUMS MAY CARRY OFFENSIVE, HARMFUL, INACCURATE, OR OTHERWISE INAPPROPRIATE MATERIAL, OR IN SOME CASES, POSTINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MISLABELED OR ARE OTHERWISE DECEPTIVE. WE EXPECT THAT YOU WILL USE CAUTION AND COMMON SENSE, AND EXERCISE PROPER JUDGMENT WHEN USING DISCUSSION FORUMS.</h4>
          <p>Any information (including personally identifiable information or other personal information) that you reveal in a Forum, may, by design, be open to the public, and in such case may not constitute a private, secure service. You should think carefully before disclosing any information in any Forum. What you have written may be seen, disclosed to, or collected by third parties and may potentially be used by others in ways we are unable to control or predict, including to contact you for unauthorized purposes. By submitting communications or content to Forums, you agree that such submission is non-confidential for all purposes, unless the Company specifically notes otherwise (for example, in the rules for a particular Forum, if any).  You agree that you will not upload or transmit any communications or content of any type to a Forum that infringe or violate any rights of any party. Further, you have agreed to restrict your actions in certain ways as described in these Terms and Conditions, including, without limitation, as outlined in the<strong>Prohibited Activities</strong> section.</p>

          <h4 class='sub-title'>Grant of Rights to Company Regarding Your Posts and Submissions</h4>
          <p>To the extent that you are the original copyright holder of any post or submission by you to a Forum, and such post or submission does not contain any of the information or material of Company, then (a) you remain owner of such post or submission to the extent you were the owner; (b) you automatically grant on behalf of yourself or otherwise warrant that the owner of such content or intellectual property has expressly granted Company, a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, world-wide nonexclusive license to use, reproduce, create derivative works from, modify, publish, edit, translate, distribute, perform, display, and/or otherwise exploit, the post, submission, communication, or content in any media or medium, or any form, format, or forum now known or hereafter developed; and (c) you agree and warrant that Company may sublicense or assign its rights through multiple tiers of sublicenses or assigns.</p>
          
          <h4 class='sub-title'>No Obligation to Monitor or Remove Content from Links</h4>
          <p>Company does not control the information delivered to the Forums, and has no obligation to monitor the Forums. However, Company reserves the right at all times to disclose any information as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or legal governmental request, or to edit, refuse to post, or to remove any information or materials, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, in Company’s sole discretion. Company is not obligated to remove any content from the site which does not violate any civil or criminal laws, and any contributions intended for display on this web site via any means, whether submitted via HTTP (web), SMTP (mail), NNTP (newsreader), or otherwise, are presumed to be contributed by the author/contributor with the intent that Company shall have an ongoing, non-exclusive right to publish the contributed content for an indefinite amount of time, unless the content submitted was made under an agreement with Company with differing terms, or Company has clearly only been provided limited, non-exclusive publishing rights (for example, in the case of some exclusively copyrighted newsletter content). If you do not wish to have something which you submit to be published, do not submit it in the first place.</p>
          <h4 class='sub-title'>No Endorsement</h4>
          <p>Company does not endorse, support, represent, or guarantee the truthfulness, accuracy, or reliability of any communications posted in the Forums, or endorse any opinions expressed in the Forums. You acknowledge that any reliance on material posted in the Forums will be at your own risk.</p>
          <h4 class='sub-title'>Company’s Right to Act</h4>
          <p>If Company discovers communications that allegedly do not conform to any terms and conditions of this Site, Company may investigate the allegation and determine in good faith, and in its sole discretion, whether to remove or request the removal of the communication. Company will have no liability or responsibility for performance or non-performance of such activities. Company reserves the right to terminate or restrict your access to any or all of the Forums at any time, without notice, for any reason whatsoever. You acknowledge that some Forums available through the Site are available only through the Site and others are available both through the Site and other sources, such as Usenet, over which Company has absolutely no control.</p>
          <p>DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS ON LIABILITY</p>
          <h4 class='sub-title'>Warranty</h4>
          <p>Company may, from time to time, offer warranties for particular products or services offered by or through the Site. Any such warranties, if given, will be specifically set forth in writing in the Site description of the product or service offered. Except for any such express warranties, all Site Content, including, without limitation, any products and services offered by or through the Site, shall be governed by and subject to the disclaimers and limitation of liability described below.</p>
          <h4 class='sub-title'>General Disclaimer of Warranties</h4>
          <p>The services, products, and content on or accessed from this site are provided “as is,” and without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We disclaim all warranties to the maximum extent of the law, express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.</p>
          <p>Neither we, nor any of our respective licensors or suppliers, warrant that any functions contained in the site will be uninterrupted or error-free, that defects will be corrected, or that the site or the server that makes them available are free of viruses or other harmful components.</p>
          <p>Neither we, nor any of our respective licensors or suppliers, warrant or make any representations regarding the use or the results of the use of the services, products, or content offered or accessed on the site in terms of their correctness, accuracy, reliability, or otherwise.</p>
          <p>Applicable law may not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. To the extent any warranty cannot be disclaimed, a limited explicit warranty is given by Company to the exclusion of any other remedy as follows: if a product or service purchased by you breaches a warranty that may not be disclaimed, and you notify Company within 30 days of purchase, the Company may, in Company’s discretion, either (a) replace the breaching service or product, or (b) refund of the monies paid for the breaching service or product.</p>
          <p>By accessing the site, you understand that you may be waiving rights with respect to claims that are, at this time, unknown or unsuspected, and in accordance with such waiver, you acknowledge that you have read and understand, and hereby expressly waive any rights law of any state or territory, that provides as follows: “a general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”</p>
          <h4 class='sub-title'>Limitation of Liability</h4>
          <p>Under no circumstances, including but not limited to negligence, will we or any of our licensors or suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, or consequential damages that result from the use of, or the inability to use or access, the Site, any Site Content, or any products or services purchased through the Site, even if advised of the possibility of such damages. Applicable law may not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability for special, incidental, consequential, or other damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. In no event, however, shall the total liability to you by Company or any of Company’s licensors or suppliers for all damages, losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) exceed the greater of (a) $100 or (b) if the liability arises from a product or service offered by the site and purchased by you, the amount paid by you to Company to purchase such product or service.</p>
          <h4 class='sub-title'>Disclaimer Regarding Content and Advice Provide On or Through the Site</h4>
          <p>Among other things, the Site (including products and services offered through the Site) provides advice from time to time, intended to assist users to improve their family, parenting skills, and personal relationships and welfare. The Company is not a medical organization and nothing on the Site is intended to constitute medical, health, or psychiatric advice. The information contained in or made available through the Site cannot and should not replace or substitute for the services of trained professionals in any field, including, but not limited to financial, medical, or legal matters. Company does not warrant or guarantee the accuracy, completeness, adequacy, or timeliness of the information contained on the Site. Accordingly, Company and its respective employees, officers, and agents accept no liability whatsoever for the consequences of any such inaccurate or misleading data, opinion, or statement. You agree that you are using the Site and the products and services offered by the Site at your own risk. By using the Site and the products and services purchased or accessed through the Site, you acknowledge that the Site and its products and services do not constitute the practice of any psychological, medical, or other professional health care advice, diagnosis, or treatment. If you wish to contract with Family Circle Counseling, Inc. in the State of Wyoming, please contact Family Circle Counseling, Inc. to set up a consultation. Use of the site or materials herein does not constitute a professional relationship with Family Circle Counseling, Inc. or Janae Harman, LPC.</p>
          <p>In particular, you should regularly consult a doctor in all matters relating to physical or mental health, particularly concerning any symptoms that may require diagnosis or medical attention. Further, you should regularly consult a lawyer in all matters relating to interacting with other people to assure that you are behaving in compliance with law, including but not limited to laws related to harassment, assault, or other similar laws. We and our licensors or suppliers make no representations or warranties concerning any treatment, action, or application of medication or preparation by any person following the information offered or provided within or through the Site (including but not limited to any product or service purchased, utilized, or otherwise obtained from the Site). Neither we, nor our licensors and suppliers, will be liable for any direct, indirect, consequential, special, exemplary, or other damages that may result from your following the information offered or provided within or through the Site and its products and services, including but not limited to economic loss, injury, illness, or death.</p>

          <p>Any dispute arising out of or related to these Terms and Conditions, the use of the Site, or the purchase of any products and services offered by or accessed through the Site shall be governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, without regard to its conflicts of law rules. Specifically, the validity, interpretation, and performance of these Terms and Conditions shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the International Sale of Goods.

          <h4 class='sub-title'>Arbitration</h4>
          <p>By using the Site, you agree that Company, at its sole discretion, may require you to submit any disputes arising from the use of the Site, or these Terms and Conditions concerning or including disputes arising from or concerning their interpretation, violation, nullity, invalidity, non-performance, or termination, as well as disputes about filling gaps in this contract or its adaptation to newly arisen circumstances, to final and binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (“Rules”), by one arbitrator, appointed in accordance with said Rules. Notwithstanding the Rules, however, such proceeding shall be located in the County of Washakie, State of Wyoming, and governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming as set forth in the previous section.</p>
          <p>Any award in an arbitration initiated under this clause shall be limited to monetary damages, and shall include no injunction or direction to any party other than the direction to pay a monetary amount.

          <p>If any provision contained in these Terms and Conditions is or becomes invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not affect the remaining provisions and portions of these Terms and Conditions, and the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified, so as to have the most similar result that is valid and enforceable under applicable Wyoming law.</p>
          <h4 class='sub-title'>Waiver</h4>
          <p>The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not affect, in any way, the first party’s right to require such performance at any time thereafter. Any waiver by either party of a breach of any provision of these Terms and Conditions shall not be taken or held by the other party to be a continuing waiver of that provision unless such waiver is made in writing.</p>
