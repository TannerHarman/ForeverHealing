## Complete Before Launch

## Future optimizations
* Add Script to insert menu & footer on each page to reduce duplicate code
* Impliment script to insert links on menu based on device (IE phone & email links for Iphone, Android, etc)
* Refactor Service.js. Code is terrible right now.
* Refactor CSS Code to be more concise - Especially Greif & Couples pages. Very similar. No need for such repeat code.
